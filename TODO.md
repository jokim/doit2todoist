Missing functionality
=====================

What the script could be extended with:

- The repetition settings for repeating tasks are not added to Todoist, as it
  needs a bit of translation.

- Repeating tasks get the wrong due date, set from the first occurrence way
  back.

- Interactive mode. The user could be asked for what should happen with tasks,
  e.g. what the due date should be set to, what project all tasks should go into
  etc.

- Subtasks from Doit.im are missing
