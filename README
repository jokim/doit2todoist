Short script for importing projects and tasks into Todoist.

Todoist only supports importing tasks into one project at a time. I want to
import all my projects from Doit.im in one go.

Export data from Doit.im
========================

Doit.im doesn't seem to like support for exporting your data, so a workaround is
needed.

Export projects
---------------

To get all *projects* from Doit.im, you need to...

1. Run your browser in development mode (<F12>)

2. Go to https://i.doit.im/home/#/project/all

3. Run the javascript code:

    $('body').text(JSON.stringify(Doit.projects));

4. Save the HTML document.

5. Open the HTML document and strip out the remaining HTML elements.

You now have a valid JSON file, with all your projects' details. This could be
used for any import you would like, as it's easy to convert from JSON.

Export tasks
------------

To get all *tasks* from Doit.im: 

1. Run your browser in development mode (<F12>)

2. Get a list of all the tasks you want to export. You could for instance create
   a filter to get these listed out.

3. Run the javascript code:

    $('body').text(JSON.stringify(TASKS));

4. Save the HTML document.

5. Open the HTML document and strip out the remaining HTML elements.

You now have a valid JSON file, with all the tasks' details. This could be used
for any import you would like, as it's easy to convert from JSON.
